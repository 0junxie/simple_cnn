# simple_cnn

simple_cnn is a project ment to be an easy to understand and easy to use convolutional neural network example.
It also avoids using virtual classes or complicated c++ features so that it is easy to convert to CUDA code later on.

Only example it was used on currently is ment to recognize handwritten digits.
For more details about it you can see \Example MNIST.
