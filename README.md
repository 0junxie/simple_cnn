# simple_cnn

simple_cnn is a project ment to be an easy to understand and easy to use convolutional neural network example.
It also avoids using virtual classes or complicated c++ features so that it is easy to convert to CUDA code later on.


Example use on handwritten digit recognition (Youtube Video):
